## Introduction

This Favourites page was created using `MERN` stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js) to assist Loanhood members to view an user's favourite items. The page has 2 main features:

- When a Loanhood member first loads the page, 10 favourite items of an user will appear on the page. There is a Load more button at the end. 
- When a Loanhood member clicks the load more button, the next N items will appear on the page.

An additional feature I have add is a drop down that includes names of some users and when we click each of them the favourite items will change according to that person's favourite items.

The architecture diagram of the solution is as follows:

Some dummy data for users and items were generated (using `faker` library) and inserted to MongoDB Database (MongoDB Atlas). Node.js was used as a driver to connect to the database and perform CRUD operations. 

`Material UI`, an open-source React component library that implements Google's Material Design, was utilised for some front-end component design.

## Data model

Since MongoDB is a No-SQL database and has a [flexible schema model](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/data-modeling/schema-design-process/), I did not need to define a schema for the database.

If required, MongoDB offers schema validation or instead of using MongoDB client we can use `mongoose` library, that is a Node.js-based Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB to define the data models. 

For this use case, I created a database called `loanhood` with 2 collections `users` and `items`.

- For the `user` collection the following fields and data types are added:

    - first_name: String
    - last_name: String
    - user_name: String
    - gender: String
    - email: String
    - phone_number: String
    - address: String
    - avatar_url: String
    - favourites: Array of items ids

    Each item in the collection is called a document. Example:
    ```
    {
        _id: "65bae495a09dc7347b48c753",
        first_name: "Fae",
        last_name: "Kuhic",
        user_name: "fae.kuhic123",
        gender: "male",
        email: "fae.kuhic@mail.com",
        phone_number: "880-865-1437",
        address: "648 Railroad Avenue Apt. 363",
        avatar_url: "https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/Qmd3W5DuhgHirLHGVixi6V76LhCkZUz6pnFt5AJBiyvHye/avatar/1037.jpg",

        "65bae692b945af93296f3444",
        "65bae651502259e40dfd6ebc",
        "65bae651502259e40dfd6eb4",
        "65bae692b945af93296f343c",
        "65bae651502259e40dfd6eb6",
        "65bae651502259e40dfd6eb2",
        "65bae651502259e40dfd6eb0",
        "65bae651502259e40dfd6eb3",
        "65bae651502259e40dfd6eac"
        ]
    },
    
    ```

- For the `items` collection, the following fields and data types are added:
    - product_name: String
    - size: Integer
    - description: String
    - brand: String
    - rental_price: Integer
    - retail_price: Integer
    - image: Base64 String 
    - owner_id: String

    Example:

    ```
    _id: "65bae651502259e40dfd6eaa",
    product_name: "Lydia Jackson shoes",
    size: 6,
    description: "Elevate your look with this pair of futuristic high-fashion wonders. The unconventional design and modern accents add a touch of avant-garde sophistication to your ensemble.",
    brand: "Lydia Jackson",
    rental_price: 322,
    retail_price: 1962,
    image: <base64string>
    owner_id: "65bae6e07c1b1c2ce959a579
    ```

## Steps to run

### Pre-requisites

Install dependencies packages by running the command below in both `server` and `src` folders.

```
npm install
```

### Steps 

#### 1. Start the server

- Open your terminal, use cd command to move to `server` directory 
    ```
    cd server
    ```
- Add a .env file with the following details about the MongoDB server:
    ```
    ATLAS_URI=<uri_provided_via_email>
    ```
- Start the server
    ```
    node index.mjs
    ```
    If successful, you should receive the following message in the terminal
    ```
    Successfully connected to the database!
    Server is running on port: 8080
    ```

    Please contact me if you have any issues connecting to MongoDB and I may need to add your IP address due to security setting of the cluster.


#### 2.Start the client (React) 

- Open your terminal, use cd command to move to `src` directory 
    ```
    cd ../src
    ```
- Run the following command
    ```
    npm run start
    ```
    If successful, the browser will automatically launch and you can access it via http://localhost:3000.
